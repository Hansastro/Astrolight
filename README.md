# Astrolights
The goal of this repository is to collect element about image processing for astronomy.

Here nothing revolutionary. It is just a place to place some piece of code or reference to learn about image processing.

The idea is to have a better understanding on image processing and learn things about how it works.

Check the [Wiki](https://github.com/Hansastro/Astrolights/wiki) page for more infos.
